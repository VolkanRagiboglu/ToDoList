# ToDoList

## How to Run:
- Download or fork the project into your local and start the live server from index.html file or if you have node installed, run command http-server and from your browser navigate to localhost

## Future Improvements
- Could add a function that transitions to a checkmark from a complete button
- There could be a index that follows each todo item to list how many items are there
